# Bored Ape Yacht Club Top-8 Expensive NFTs Scraper and MongoDB Integration

According to Wikipedia, the Bored Ape Yacht Club is a non-fungible token (NFT) collection built on the Ethereum blockchain.  The collection features profile pictures of cartoon apes that are procedurally generated by an algorithm.  As of 2022, [Bored Ape Yacht Clubâ€™s parent company,] Yuga Labs, is valued at US$4 billion.  This is due in large part to the sales of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection totaling over US$1 billion. Various celebrities have purchased these non-fungible tokens, including Justin Bieber, Snoop Dogg, Gwyneth Paltrow and others.

The project involves using Selenium to scrape data from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection on OpenSea. Specifically, the code will select all apes with "Solid gold" fur and sort them by "Price high to low" on the OpenSea website. Then, the code will click on the top 8 most expensive Bored Apes and save the resulting details page to disk as "bayc_[N].htm", with [N] being the ape number. Finally, the code will extract the name and attributes of each of the 8 apes from the HTML files and store them in a MongoDB collection called "bayc".
